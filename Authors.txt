===================

Awl is mostly written by Lucas Soltic (aka Ceylo) but some files
were directly imported from SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/), with some additions,
and are thereby mostly the work of Laurent Gomila:
- Config
- Lock
- Mutex
- Platform
- Sleep
- Thread

Awl also includes a subset of Boost (http://www.boost.org/) in include/Awl/boost. These files were modified to fit the <Awl/...> include scheme.
